# UI-design-challenge

Hi!

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us.

We would now like you to complete a brief design challenge in order for us
to get an understanding of your approach to UI design and design tooling.

Your task will be to design a user dashboard which provides an intuitive and simple way to access
content modules within our learning management system. The supplied branding guideline 
'branding-guideline.pdf' provides the style to follow but it's up to you how the user interface 
should be constructed. Each module will consist of:

- Title
- Hero picture (not provided)
- Rating
- Author

## Instructions:

- Fork this repo (this contains all assets required, as well as a data.json file to define module information)
- Generate a new XD file and create an simple design using the supplied style guide
- Design the dashboard and module display however you like
- Once complete, supply hello@netfront.com.au a link to the XD along with the password lock to review


The most important aspects that we will be reviewing is your attention to detail and design direction. 
This will include your ability to show a clean, simple interface for would be users to be able to access 
different modules easily and quickly irrespective of device. 


### Extra credit
We understand time restraints - so the following are completely optional
- Accessibility checks (and variation on design to meet standards)
- Interactive XD elements (i.e load, hover, click interactions)
- Responsive versions

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us!
